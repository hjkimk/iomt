## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results achieved in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Process the logged data available in the `data_collection` folder using the `read_file_bluesee_1.py` Python script.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Generate the dataframe for model inputs, visualize data, and train classification models such as SVM and Decision Tree using the `classification_algorithm_2.py` script.

3. **Demo**:
   - Visualize previously unseen data in real-time by accessing the files located in the `demo` folder using the `demo_3.py` script.

## Additional Information

- **Trained Models**:
  - Find the models utilized for the results in the `trained_ML_models` folder.

- **Real-time Demo Visualizations**:
  - Access the videos showcasing real-time demo visualizations in the `demo_result_animations` folder.
